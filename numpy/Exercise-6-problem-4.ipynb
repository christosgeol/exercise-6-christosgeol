    "- From `Station Detail & Data Flag Options` choose only **Geographic Location**. **Notice:** Do **NOT** include data flags because it makes the data difficult to read. Use **Standard** units.\n",

    "1. Calculate the temperature anomalies in Sodankyla, i.e., the difference between referenceTemps and the average temperature for each month (see Problem 3). \n",
    "2. Calculate the monthly temperature differences between Sodankyla and Helsinki stations\n",
    "3. How different the summer temperatures (June, July, August) have been between Helsinki (used in Problems 1-3) and Sodankyla station?\n",
    "    - Calculate the monthly differences into a NumPy array and save it (as a `CSV` file) into your own Exercise repository for this week\n",
    "    - What were the summer mean temperatures for both of these stations?\n",
    "    - What were the summer standard deviations for both of these stations?\n",
